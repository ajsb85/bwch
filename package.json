  "description": "BwCh is a JavaScript API to detect bandwidth for web-based environments. \r It uses some of the latest JavaScript innovation (window.navigator.connection currently \r supported in Chrome 48+ for Android as of April 2016)\r in order to provide a flexible method to detect bandwidth for both mobile and desktop \r devices. \r It fallbacks to image pre-loading to detect bandwidth where those newest API are not available.",
